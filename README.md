# Asteroids Clone - Unity 2D Game

## Description

Welcome to my Asteroids Clone, a classic space-themed 2D game developed using Unity. In this game, you take control of a spaceship navigating through an asteroid-filled space. Your objective is to destroy the asteroids while avoiding collisions to survive as long as possible and score the highest points.

## Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys (or WASD keys) to control the spaceship's movement.
- Press the space bar to shoot projectiles and destroy asteroids.
- Destroying larger asteroids will split them into smaller ones, adding to the challenge.

## Object Pooling

To optimize performance, I have implemented object pooling for asteroids. This technique reuses objects instead of instantiating and destroying them, reducing memory allocation and improving the game's overall performance.

## High Score System

Compete with your friends to achieve the highest score! The game includes a high score system that keeps track of the best scores achieved by players. Can you make it to the top of the leaderboard?
